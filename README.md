# VEVP Constitutive Model In Finite Strain (Python version)
## Overview
This repository contains the pthon implementation of the homogeneous VEVP constitutive model in finite strain.

Details of the mathematical formulation and results can be found in the following paper:

A finite strain thermodynamically-based constitutive framework coupling viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity with application to glassy polymers.

## Project Structure
InputFile.txt : This file contains the VE-VP material properties. It includes also the simulation settings (loading, time, etc).

SecantMFHFiniteStrain.py : The main file to run the homogeneous VEVP constitutive law.
